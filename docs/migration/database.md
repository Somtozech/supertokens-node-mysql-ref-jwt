- Our library will create two tables for you as mentioned [here](../backend/installation#3-optionally-create-tables-in-the-mysql-database). You can either give it a new database, or your existing database. 

- We recommend giving it a new database as this way you can create MySQL users specifically for that database. This will ensure to you that our library will not have access to any of your existing data.
